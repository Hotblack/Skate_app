Skate
-----

Skate App is an iPhone app designed for the immediate needs of every skateboarder that is looking for cool places to skate and cool people in their local area. The app allows skaters to find/add skate spots to an interactive map and broadcast their location for impromptu meetups with other skaters.


Overview
--------

Skate App's main feature is the Skate Map. This map shows locations of popular skate spots around the city as well as Meetup locations of other skateboarders looking to other people to skate with. Spots are shown as red pins and Meetups are shown as blue pins.

Clicking on any skate spot will show an image of that spot as well as user comments for that spot. Clicking on any Meetup will show who posted that Meetup along with their Facebook profile picture and comments by other users on that Meetup.

In order to post new spots, start a Meetup, or post comments, users must first login through Facebook.
